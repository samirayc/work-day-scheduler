# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This application was made for Module 5s Homework Challenge. It is a calendar application that lets users input any event, meeting, or appointment onto a work schedule for the hours of a typical working day (9AM to 5PM). For this project, I was given starter code that I added on to make the application work correctly. This app uses jQuery and Day.js, as well as CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

## Usage
This application can be accessed at https://samirayc.github.io/work-day-scheduler/ by copying and pasting it into your browser. Once opened, the page should look similar to:
![Alt text](<Develop/Images/Work Day Scheduler.png>)

Past hours will be in grey, the current hour will be in red, and future hours will be in green. When you click on a time block, you will be able to type in whatever event or appointment you may have.

To save this appointment, click on the blue save button off to the right of the screen. The event will be saved and a confirmation message will appear for a couple seconds at the top of the screen.
